Before she even joined, we exchanged emails where she shared some of the personal projects she had built using Python and React—technologies heavily used at our company. It was clear from the outset that she was already ahead of the curve.\nOnce Yan started her internship, she immediately stood out as someone who was eager to learn and quick to adapt. She absorbed new concepts like a sponge, asked thoughtful questions, and proactively engaged with relevant stakeholders. I helped guide her early instincts, and she was very receptive to feedback, taking it to heart and applying it effectively. Her internship project involved migrating one of our pages from a legacy Python web app to a modern stack using Node.js, React, GraphQL, and Apollo. GraphQL was new to her, but through regular meetings and her own dedication, she was able to grasp the concepts and implement them successfully.\nThe results of her project had a tangible impact. She built reusable React components that not only benefited our team but were adopted by several other teams as well. She wrapped up the internship with a detailed and well-structured presentation that included performance metrics, showcasing both the technical quality and the business value of her work.\nBringing Yan on as a full-time engineer was an easy decision. She continued working on the migration project while also contributing to the legacy application, participating in deployments, and handling run-the-business responsibilities. As a Software Engineer I, she consistently performed at a level well beyond her title—taking full ownership of her assigned projects, collaborating closely with our product manager and designer, and making sure all concerns were addressed effectively.\nYan didn’t stop there—she actively sought out feedback from her technical peers to continue improving her skills, and even collaborated with a backend-focused team outside of her own to help design APIs that would support our frontend needs. Her initiative and cross-team communication made a real difference in the success of our work.\nAll in all, I’m incredibly proud of Yan and the progress she has made. She is well on her way to becoming a high-impact individual contributor and would be a valuable asset to any team she joins.”\n— Justin Lui, Staff Software Engineer at SurveyMonkey\n“I had the pleasure of working with Yan at SurveyMonkey. She is an extremely talented engineer with a problem-solving mindset and the ability to deliver high quality work under tight deadlines. She has excellent communication skills, collaborates well, and actively contributed to the success of the entire team. She always put in the same high level of effort and attention to detail, whether working on high profile projects or small bug fixes.\nWhat I appreciated most about Yan is that she always took ownership over the work she did, asked great questions, and provided suggestions on how to improve the experience. I thoroughly enjoyed working with her and highly recommend her to any organization looking for a skilled, dependable, and collaborative engineer.”\n— Karen Hong, Product Manager at SurveyMonkey\n“Yan was in my MBA International Business course (Fall 2017). This is an intensive 6-week course involving a lot of reading, extensive research, individual and group work. She submitted quality work (individual and team work) and achieved commendable results in the course. I am convinced that she will do well in our MBA program and wish her success in her career.”\n— Dr. Diane A. Isabelle, Associate Professor, International Business, Consultant and Board Vice Chair\n",
