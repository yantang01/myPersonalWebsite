[{"content":" Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Yan. I\u0026rsquo;m a third-year student studying Computer Science at Carleton University in Ottawa, and this is not my first degree. My previous degree was a Bachelor of Commerce obtained in China, where I was born and raised.\nWhen I came to Canada in 2017, I chose to study for an MBA to build fundamental business skills. After that, I had three years of work experience in the Finance/Accounting industry. My previous role before transitioning into CS was as a Senior Accountant with an international non-profit Digital Opportunity Trust, where we focused on empowering youth to become innovators and leaders by applying digital solutions that have a positive impact in their communities.\nI fell in love with Computer Science due to its powerful ability to change people‚Äôs lives. I am an efficiency nerd who is always looking for efficiencies that can be gained at work. I love using technological tools to increase productivity and improve my workflow. When I turned a 2-hour assignment into only 5 minutes using programming knowledge I taught myself during my spare time, I felt so excited and gained an immense sense of achievement. However, I realized that was not enough for me. I wanted to get myself fully involved, and decided to transition into CS. Here I Am.\nI am an incoming software developer who understands the business side of things and communicates well with others. I like solving problems, building applications, and getting my hands dirty while learning.\nFeel free to reach out via LinkedIn or send me an email if you would like to connect! I am thrilled to meet new people and learn about your stories.\n","permalink":"https://yantang.netlify.app/about/","summary":"Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Yan.

It\u0026rsquo;s a static site (fast and responsive) built using Hugo with PaperMod theme. Deployed using Netlify. Streamy React Web App React/Redux (GitHub)\nThis project was built during the process of learning React. It\u0026rsquo;s a video streaming web application where users can record videos and stream live to other people. Utilized both class-based and functional React components and developed reusable components to increase development productivity. Fully implemented CRUD operations and used Redux to manage states across components. YelpCamp Web App HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, MongDB (Website | GitHub)\nThis was my first project, which I did after completing the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. It\u0026rsquo;s a full-stack, JavaScript CRUD web app where people browse/post campgrounds and share reviews of campgrounds. Technologies used were close to MERN stack except not using React. I learned a lot by doing this project: HTML/CSS, JS, back-end tools Node.js/Express.js, NoSQL cloud database MongoDB Atlas, REST, authentication, deploying apps, and so on. Search Engine Python (GitHub)\nA web crawler and a search engine built with Python (100% independently). I was able to improve runtime efficiency from 20 minutes to only 1 minute by writing clean and efficient code. Implemented PageRank algorithm (used by Google search) in the search function to improve the quality of search result.
