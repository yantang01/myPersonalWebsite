[{"content":" Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Yan. I\u0026rsquo;m a third-year student studying Computer Science at Carleton University in Ottawa, and this is not my first degree. My previous degree was a Bachelor of Commerce obtained in China, where I was born and raised.\nWhen I came to Canada in 2017, I chose to study for an MBA to build fundamental business skills. After that, I had three years of work experience in the Finance/Accounting industry. My previous role before transitioning into CS was as a Senior Accountant with an international non-profit Digital Opportunity Trust, where we focused on empowering youth to become innovators and leaders by applying digital solutions that have a positive impact in their communities.\nI fell in love with Computer Science due to its powerful ability to change people’s lives. I am an efficiency nerd who is always looking for efficiencies that can be gained at work. I love using technological tools to increase productivity and improve my workflow. When I turned a 2-hour assignment into only 5 minutes using programming knowledge I taught myself during my spare time, I felt so excited and gained an immense sense of achievement. However, I realized that was not enough for me. I wanted to get myself fully involved, and decided to transition into CS. Here I Am.\nI am an incoming software developer who understands the business side of things and communicates well with others. I like solving problems, building applications, and getting my hands dirty while learning.\nFeel free to reach out via LinkedIn or send me an email if you would like to connect! I am thrilled to meet new people and learn about your stories.\n","permalink":"https://yantang.netlify.app/about/","summary":"Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Yan.

It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful (at least in my opinion 🙂), clean, fast, and responsive site built using Hugo with PaperMod theme. YelpCamp Web App HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, MongDB (Website | GitHub)\nThis is my first project, which I did after completing the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy. We built a full-stack, fully functional CRUD web app where people create campgrounds and share reviews of campgrounds. I learned a lot by doing this project: HTML/CSS (Bootstrap/Semantic UI), JS, back-end tools Node.js/Express.js, NoSQL database MongDB, REST, authentication, deploying apps, and so on. Videos App React (GitHub)\nThis project was built in the process of learning React. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple React app where we used YouTube API to fetch videos from YouTube (based on user search term) to our website. The selected/clicked video will also play on the site. Course Projects 📚 Search Engine Python (GitHub)\nComing soon.
