      <description>Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!
I&amp;rsquo;m Yan. I&amp;rsquo;m a third-year student studying Computer Science at Carleton University in Ottawa, and this is not my first degree. My previous degree was a Bachelor of Commerce obtained in China, where I was born and raised.
When I came to Canada in 2017, I chose to study for an MBA to build fundamental business skills. After that, I had three years of work experience in the Finance/Accounting industry.</description>

      <description>My Personal Website Hugo, Netlify (GitHub)
The website you are looking at right now! It&amp;rsquo;s a static site (fast and responsive) built using Hugo with PaperMod theme. Deployed using Netlify. Streamy React Web App React/Redux (GitHub)
This project was built during the process of learning React. It&amp;rsquo;s a video streaming web application where users can record videos and stream live to other people. Utilized both class-based and functional React components and developed reusable components to increase development productivity.</description>
