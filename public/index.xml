      <description>Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!
I&amp;rsquo;m Yan. I&amp;rsquo;m a third-year student studying Computer Science at Carleton University in Ottawa, and this is not my first degree. My previous degree was a Bachelor of Commerce obtained in China, where I was born and raised.
When I came to Canada in 2017, I chose to study for an MBA to build fundamental business skills. After that, I had three years of work experience in the Finance/Accounting industry.</description>
