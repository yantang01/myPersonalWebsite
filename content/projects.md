## Side Projects 💫

### My Personal Website

> _HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Hugo, Netlify ([GitHub]())_

- The website you are looking at right now!
- It's a beautiful (at least in my opinion 🙂), clean, fast, and responsive site built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) theme.

### YelpCamp Web App

> _HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, MongDB ([Website]() | [GitHub]())_

- This is my first project, which I did after completing the [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).
- We built a full-stack, fully functional CRUD web app where people create campgrounds and share reviews of campgrounds.
- I learned a lot by doing this project: HTML/CSS([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)/[Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/))/JS, back-end tools [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), NoSQL database [MongDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), REST, authentication, deploying apps, and so on.

### Videos App

> _React ([GitHub]())_

- This project was built in the process of learning [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- It's a simple React app where we used YouTube API to fetch videos from YouTube (based on user search term) to our website.
- The selected/clicked video will also play on the site.
