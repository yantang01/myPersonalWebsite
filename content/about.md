<!-- intro -->

Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm Yan. I'm a third-year student studying Computer Science at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/) in Ottawa, and this is not my first degree. My previous degree was a Bachelor of Commerce obtained in China, where I was born and raised.

When I came to Canada in 2017, I chose to study for an [MBA](https://sprott.carleton.ca/mba) to build fundamental business skills. After that, I had three years of work experience in the Finance/Accounting industry. My previous role before transitioning into CS was as a Senior Accountant with an international non-profit [Digital Opportunity Trust](https://www.dotrust.org/), where we focused on empowering youth to become innovators and leaders by applying digital solutions that have a positive impact in their communities.

I fell in love with Computer Science due to its powerful ability to change peopleâ€™s lives. I am an efficiency nerd who is always looking for efficiencies that can be gained at work. I love using technological tools to increase productivity and improve my workflow. When I turned a 2-hour assignment into only 5 minutes using programming knowledge I taught myself during my spare time, I felt so excited and gained an immense sense of achievement. However, I realized that was not enough for me. I wanted to get myself fully involved, and decided to transition into CS. Here I Am.

I am an incoming software developer who understands the business side of things and communicates well with others. I like solving problems, building applications, and getting my hands dirty while learning.

Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yantang01) or send me an [email](mailto:yantang0727@gmail.com) if you would like to connect! I am thrilled to meet new people and learn about your stories.
