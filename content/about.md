<!-- intro -->

Hello, welcome to my corner of the internet!

Iâ€™m Yan. I graduated with a Computer Science degree from Carleton University in Ottawa, and Iâ€™m currently a Software Developer. However, my journey to this point wasnâ€™t linear, and thatâ€™s something Iâ€™m proud of.

I started with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in China, where I was born and raised. In 2017, I moved to Canada and pursued an MBA to build fundamental business skills. Afterward, I worked in the Finance/Accounting industry for three years. My last role was as a Senior Accountant at Digital Opportunity Trust, a non-profit focused on empowering youth through digital solutions.

Despite my success in finance, I discovered my passion for Computer Science because of its potential to change lives. Iâ€™m an efficiency nerd, always looking for ways to streamline work processes. The moment I turned a 2-hour task into a 5-minute one using programming I taught myself, I realized that this was where I truly belonged. I made the decision to pursue my passion full-time, and here I am today, a software developer with a strong business background.

I love solving problems, building applications, and continuously learning. As a developer, I not only understand the technical side but also the business side, which helps me communicate effectively with cross-functional teams.

Feel free to check out my [work experience](/work/) to see what Iâ€™ve been up to as a Software Developer. If youâ€™re interested in hearing what others have to say about my work, head over to my [recommendations](/recommendations/).

Iâ€™m always excited to meet new people and learn about your experiences. Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yantang01) or send me an [email](mailto:yantangcs@gmail.com)!
